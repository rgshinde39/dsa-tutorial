Data structures
	these are the way data is stored on computer memory, knowing the best data structure for your case will help achieve efficiency
Algorithms
	Alorightm is a flow including steps to solve a given problem, here we break the problem into small parts and work on them, at last we combine the result

Recursion
	its a way of solving problems where a method calls itself for no of times
	it takes a lot of memory on stack because each method call and its results are stored on stack till last recursion call
	
when to use recursion
	when problem can be broken down into parts
	when we are not worried about how much time it takes to run our code
	when we need fast solution instead of a efficient one
	when traversing a tree
	
when to avoid recursion
	when we need to consider how much time a program takes to complete
	when we want to write program thats memory efficient

steps to write recursion
1. the actual flow
2. the exit condition
3. the constraint

programs
	factorial
	fibonacci numbers - a number is sum of last 2 numbers, series starts with 0,1
	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13.....
